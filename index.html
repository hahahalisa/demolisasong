<h2>Hey There! I'm Haneul👋🏻 </h2>
<p>☁️ I’m a product developer with a strong background in visual arts 🎨 Haneul(하늘)  <br>means “sky” in Korean. My parents have named me “Haneul” to live life freely like the sky!</p>

<p>👋🏻 I'm a creative problem solver who loves a good challenge. Currently at New York University <br>studying Visual Arts with a concentration in human-centered design. Outside of work and school, <br>I'm always looking for new ways to make myself better and explore this big city!</p>


<p>💡 I began learning drawing and painting when I was six years old. My strong interest in art and design <br> pushes me to pursue a career in design. I later discovered my passion for product design through the <br>product design internship at Rocket in 2020. I now aim towards combining my learnings <br> of visual arts with UX to integrate diverse perspectives and a collaborative approach to <br> the product innovation process.</p>

<p>✨ During my free time, I love to paint 🎨, cook 🍳, and discover new restaurants in the city😄 I run a Foodstagram and upload restaurant reviews on a weekly basis <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ikhayumm/"> @ikhayumm! </a>Check out some of the best restaurants in New York City🍔 </p>

<p>☕ I love connecting with fellow designers of all experience levels — feel free to reach out by <span> Email, <br> LinkedIn, Instagram!</span></p>
